# Quantum Key Exchange (Kyber512-JS)-works with 768, and 1024 also.

Key Generation:

Use KeyGen512 to generate a public/private key pair.

Shared Secret Generation:

Use Encrypt512 to encapsulate a shared secret with the public key.
Use Decrypt512 to decapsulate the shared secret with the private key.

Shared Secret to Entropy:

Hash the shared secret using SHA-256 to derive entropy.

BTC and ETH Key Derivation:

Use the entropy as a private key for BTC and ETH key generation.

# Key Points

CRYSTALS-Kyber Integration:

The KeyGen512 function generates the key pair.
The Encrypt512 function generates the shared secret and ciphertext.
The Decrypt512 function recovers the shared secret using the private key.
Shared Secret to Entropy:

The shared secret is hashed with SHA-256 to derive 32 bytes of entropy.
BTC Key Pair:

The entropy is used as a private key for the secp256k1 curve.
A compressed public key and Bitcoin address are derived.
ETH Key Pair:

The entropy is used as a private key for the secp256k1 curve.
The Ethereum address is derived by hashing the public key with Keccak-256.

Private Key: [Array of bytes]
Encrypting shared secret...
Ciphertext: [Array of bytes]
Shared Secret (Sender): [Array of bytes]
Decrypting shared secret...
Shared Secret (Receiver): [Array of bytes]
Generating BTC key pair...
BTC Private Key: [Hex string]
BTC Public Key: [Hex string]

# Next Steps
Test on Blockchain:

Verify the BTC and ETH addresses on their respective blockchains.

Integrate into a Wallet:

Store the private keys securely in a wallet environment.

Optimize for Performance:

Profile the Encrypt512 and Decrypt512 functions for real-time usage.
